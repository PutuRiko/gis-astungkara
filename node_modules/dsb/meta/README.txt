The DSB stands for Dynamic Software Builder.

It's a collection of over 100 modules, big and small, that accomplish great things with minimal footprint. Great strides have been taken to make sure the methods within are as intuitive and easy to use as possible.

As it stands, I plan to release a few of my most useful modules (around 12 in all, I suppose).

- root
- defined
- toString 
- toArray 
- typecheck 
- compare
- count
- is
- each
- has
- merge
- debug-mini
